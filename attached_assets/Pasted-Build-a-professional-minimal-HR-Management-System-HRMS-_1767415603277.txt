Build a professional, minimal HR Management System (HRMS) named "Dayflow". The design must be clean, corporate, and scannable. Strictly use Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and HeroUI (formerly NextUI). Do not use shadcn/ui. All data must be static/mocked for now, but structured to support future API integration.

1. Layout & Navigation (Role-Based):

Persistent Sidebar: Minimal navigation with icons (Dashboard, Employees, Attendance, Time Off, Payroll).

Topbar: Include a Search bar, Notification icon, and a Profile dropdown.

Tab-Based Navigation: For the main dashboard and detail pages, use HeroUI Tabs for: "Employees", "Attendance", and "Time Off".

2. Authentication System:

Sign In: Center-aligned card with fields for Login ID or Email and Password.

Sign Up (Admin only): Form for Company Name (with logo upload), Full Name, Email, Phone, and Password.

ID Logic Note: Include a non-functional UI element showing the auto-generated ID format (e.g., OIJODO20220001).

3. Employee Management (Admin View):

List View: A grid of cards showing Employee Photo, Name, and Role.

Detailed Profile: A tabbed interface for individual employees:

Info Tab: Personal details, address, and job info (Editable for Admin).

Attendance Tab: Detailed history.

Time Off Tab: Leave history and balance.

Payroll Tab: Payment history with status-colored chips (Green for Paid, Red for Unpaid).

4. Attendance & Time Off Tracking:

Attendance Table: Columns for Date, Check-in, Check-out, Work Hours, and Overtime.

Time Off Table: Columns for Leave Type, Duration, Status (Pending/Approved/Rejected), and Actions (Approve/Reject buttons for Admin).

Time Off Request Modal: Fields for Leave Type (Paid, Sick, Unpaid), Validity Period (Start/End date), Allocation (Days), and Attachment.

5. Design Guidelines:

Color Palette: Use professional shades like Indigo, Slate, and Zinc. Status colors: Present/Paid (Green), Absent/Unpaid (Red), Half-day (Yellow), Leave (Blue).

Components: Utilize HeroUI Table, Card, Modal, Tabs, Button, and Input components.

Typography: Clean sans-serif (Inter or Geist).

Recommended File Structure
To stay organized for your backend team, I suggest this architecture:

Plaintext

/src
  /app
    /login        # Sign-in page
    /signup       # Sign-up page
    /(dashboard)  # Main layout with Sidebar/Nav
      /employees  # List and Details (tabbed)
      /attendance # Attendance tables
      /leave      # Time-off management
      /payroll    # Salary views
  /components
    /ui           # Custom HeroUI wrappers
